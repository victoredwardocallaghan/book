### Brief

A book on introducing programming and the foundations of mathematics from
scratch by way of homotopy type and category theory.


### Background

This is a textbook that I am writing on a number of topics that have a deep
unexpected connection;

 * category theory
 * homotopy type theory
 * foundations of mathematics
 * programming


### Prerequisites and compilation

To compile the book you need LaTeX. [Texlive](http://www.tug.org/texlive/)
You also need the `make` utility.

There are a number of LaTeX distribution's based on which OS you run.
