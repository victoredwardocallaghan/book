In each area of mathematics (e.g., sets, groups, topological spaces) there are available many definitions
and constructions. It turns out, however, that there are a number of notions (e.g. that of a product)
that occur naturally in various areas of mathematics, with only slight changes from one area to another.
It is convenient to take advantage of this observation. Category theory can be described as that branch of mathematics
in which one studies certain definitions in a broader context - without reference to the particular area to which
the definition might be applied.
