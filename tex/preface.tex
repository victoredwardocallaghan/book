\subsection*{About this book}

This is a textbook that I am writing on a number of topics that have a deep
unexpected connection. In particular, this book introduces programming and
the foundations of mathematics from scratch by way of
\emph{homotopy type} and \emph{category theory} and explores aspects of these
topics to lead to a new era in high assurance software design and implementations.
